                    I'm an experienced product designer, developer and leader. I am passionate about design, people,
                    innovative technology and building powerful and impactful solutions. I have a unique ability to
                    speak the language of clients and senior executives whilst also communicating directly with design
                    and development teams to deliver work that solves real-world problems.

                    With over ten years of professional experience working internationally in marketing, design and
                    software development teams, I have come to love both the <strong>building</strong> of{' '}
                    <em>"all the things"</em> and <strong>leading</strong> and coordinating projects. Results, clear
                    communication, accountability and passion are qualities I live by.

                    I'm from Australia and now living in Berlin with my wife Claire and son Charlie. We love travel,
                    people, music, art, projects and nature. Being Aussie, we enjoy the sunshine - but also the cold,
                    grey weather of Berlin too!{' '}
